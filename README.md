# D&D One Shot Adventures
This is a collection of one shot adventures for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition. Each adventure is designed to be played in a single session, usually around 4 hours. Each adventure has puzzles, combat encounters, and roleplay opportunities for players to enjoy. Shout out to amazing artists who have made their work available for free on the internet. I have tried to credit them where possible. If you see your work here and would like it removed, please let me know.
