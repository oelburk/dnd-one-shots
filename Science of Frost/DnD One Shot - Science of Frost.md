# The Frost Cave

**Overall plot:**

- The adventurers enter the ancient cave, encountering icy traps and puzzles that guard the inner sanctum.
- They solve riddles or overcome challenges to progress deeper into the cave.

**Intro**:

- The party enters the Frost Cave, a vast and frigid cavern that lies hidden within the snowy mountains.

- The air is icy, and faint echoes reverberate through the chamber as they step deeper into the unknown.


- The cave is filled with shimmering ice formations, stalactites, and frost-covered walls that glisten in the party's light sources.

- The temperature drops even further within the cave, making it essential for the party to stay bundled up and protected from the cold.

## Phase 1 - It's a TRAP!?

![Image from DnD One Shot - Science of Frost](images/cave.png)

- As the party progresses through the Frost Cave, they encounter a series of traps and puzzles left behind by the cave's original inhabitants.

- The adventurers must rely on their perception, investigation, and problem-solving skills to bypass these obstacles safely.

# The Icy Chasm Trap

**Description:** 

As the party progresses through the Frost Cave, they come across a narrow icy chasm that stretches across the path they need to traverse. The chasm is too wide to jump across, and the depths below are filled with freezing water.

1. Crumbling Ice Platforms:The party notices a series of ice platforms, each large enough to support one person, positioned at irregular intervals across the chasm.

However, as the adventurers step onto the first platform, they notice it start to crack beneath their weight.



2. Activation Mechanism:The trap is activated when the first platform is stepped upon. The mechanism causes the ice platforms to begin crumbling one by one, slowly receding into the chasm.



3. Timing and Precision:The party must work together and time their movements precisely to cross the chasm safely.

Each party member can only occupy a platform for a limited time before it crumbles away. The timing may vary for each platform, making coordination essential.



4. Party Cooperation:The party must strategize and communicate effectively to coordinate their movements.

They can use skills like Perception or Insight to gauge the timing of the platforms or work out a pattern to cross.



5. Environmental Clues:The environment may provide clues to help the party cross the chasm.

For example, they might notice slight discolorations or cracks on certain platforms that indicate a longer lifespan before crumbling.



6. Consequences of Failure:If a party member falls into the freezing water below, they suffer damage from the icy plunge and potentially encounter icy creatures or other hazards.

The party can attempt a rescue or devise an alternative plan to retrieve their fallen comrade.



7. Reward and Progression:Upon successfully crossing the chasm, the party reaches a secure platform on the other side, leading them to the puzzle or the next phase of their journey within the Frost Cave.

## Phase 2 - Frozen Guardians

- The Frost Cave is guarded by frozen creatures or animated icy constructs that serve as protectors of the ancient secrets within.
- These guardians, such as ice golems or frost elementals, present formidable challenges to the party.
- The adventurers must engage in combat or find alternative methods, such as melting the ice or using fire-based magic, to overcome these guardians.

![Image from DnD One Shot - Science of Frost](maps/frozen_guardians.png)

## Phase 3 - The Chilling Labyrinth

**Icy Labyrinths:**

- The Frost Cave consists of a complex network of tunnels, chambers, and interconnected passages.
- The party must navigate through these icy labyrinths, making choices at intersections and facing dead ends or hidden shortcuts.
- They may need to create maps, solve riddles, or follow clues to ensure they stay on the correct path toward their ultimate goal.

**Chilling Discoveries:**

- Along the way, the party uncovers remnants of the cave's history and its connection to the prolonged winter.
- They may find ancient artifacts, inscriptions, or murals that shed light on the origins of the frost elemental or reveal rituals for appeasing its power.
- These discoveries deepen the party's understanding of the challenges they face and provide potential solutions to resolve the winter's curse.

# The Frozen Key Puzzle

**Description:** 

The party enters a chamber with a massive frozen door blocking their path. The door has a keyhole, but the key itself is missing. However, there are four frozen pedestals in the room, each with a different symbol carved into the ice. A riddle is etched onto a nearby stone tablet:

Riddle: "In the depths of ice, where secrets lie, Seek the symbols to make the key comply. Four pedestals stand, each with a mark, Align them true, to banish the dark. Watch for the signs, the frost's embrace, To find the order, reveal the chase."

**Solution:**

1. The party must examine the symbols on the pedestals. Let's say the symbols are a snowflake, a mountain peak, a frozen tree, and an ice crystal.
2. Upon closer inspection, the party notices faint trails of frost emanating from each symbol. These trails lead to a particular spot on the frozen door.
3. The order in which the pedestals need to be activated corresponds to the order in which the frost trails intersect on the door. The party needs to recreate this pattern to unlock the door.
4. The party must touch or interact with each pedestal in the correct order according to the intersecting frost trails. For example, if the intersecting pattern goes from snowflake, then mountain peak, then frozen tree, and finally the ice crystal, the party should touch the pedestals in that specific order.
5. When the correct order is followed, the pedestals emit a faint glow, and the ice on the door begins to melt away, revealing the keyhole.
6. The party can now proceed by inserting the key they found elsewhere in the adventure into the unlocked door, granting them access to the next area of the Frost Cave.

## Phase 4 - Enter the Portal

Confronting the mad scientist:

At the heart of the Frost Cave, the party encounters newly built/conjured portal — the portal will lead them to the mad scientist lab on a parallell realm.

The lab where the confrontation takes place is adorned with crystalline ice formations and an oppressive cold that radiates from the device which holds the crystal.

The battle against the mad scientist is a climactic encounter, where the party must use their skills, teamwork, and magical abilities to defeat the tiefling and restore balance to the land.

# Restoring Balance

- After defeating the mad scientist, the party discovers a magical artifact that controls the weather.
- They learn how to use the artifact to restore balance, bringing an end to the unnatural winter and bringing hope back to Frostholm.

If the party killed the scientist they need to solve a puzzle to use the artifact

**The Frostbound Relic Puzzle**

Description: As the players explore deeper into the Frozen Forest, they stumble upon a hidden chamber adorned with intricate ice carvings. In the center of the chamber rests a pedestal with a mystical artifact known as the Frostbound Relic. This artifact has the power to control the eternal winter. However, it is locked within a puzzle mechanism that must be solved to gain control over its power. The players must decipher the puzzle's clues and manipulate the relic to progress.

**Puzzle Setup:** 

The Frostbound Relic is depicted as an ornate crystal sphere suspended above the pedestal. It emits a soft, icy glow. The players notice that the sphere has several rotating rings, each engraved with different symbols and patterns. A set of clues is inscribed on a nearby wall, guiding the players towards the correct sequence of manipulations.

**Clues:**

1. "In the realm of ice and snow, the seasons' dance you must bestow. Align the symbols, let the cycle unfold, to wield the power, brave and bold."
2. "Each symbol holds a meaning true, to the seasons they are linked, this is your clue. Summer, autumn, winter, spring, arrange them right, the balance they bring."

**Puzzle Solution:** 

The players must rotate the rings of the Frostbound Relic to align the symbols representing the four seasons in the correct order: spring, summer, autumn, winter. The solution corresponds to the natural cycle of seasons.

To manipulate the Frostbound Relic, the players must interact with the rotating rings. Each ring can be turned clockwise or counterclockwise. As they manipulate the rings, the symbols on each ring change, allowing them to align the symbols in the correct order.

**Consequences of Incorrect Attempts:** 

If the players make an incorrect attempt, the Frostbound Relic reacts, releasing a surge of icy energy that chills the chamber and causes temporary frostbite to those nearby. This serves as a warning and encourages the players to reconsider their approach.

**Successful Completion:**

Once the players align the symbols correctly, the Frostbound Relic emits a soft, steady glow, and the surrounding chamber begins to warm. The eternal winter outside the chamber starts to recede slowly. The players have gained control over the artifact, allowing them to manipulate the intensity and duration of the winter within the Frozen Forest.

**Reward:** 

Controlling the Frostbound Relic grants the players the ability to bring temporary relief from the eternal winter, granting them advantages in the Frozen Forest or potential access to previously inaccessible areas. It also opens new possibilities for interaction with NPCs and reveals deeper secrets and quests related to the winter's origin.

Remember, you can adjust the complexity and difficulty of the puzzle based on your players' preferences and the desired level of challenge. Offer hints or additional clues if needed, and reward the players' creativity and problem-solving skills.

If the party spared the mad scientist the artifact that controls the weather can be controlled much easier.
